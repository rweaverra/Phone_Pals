      <h1>Choosing to repair your phone</h1>
      There is a ridiculous amount of options to get your phone repaired. It used to be: go to the Apple store, empty your wallet, wait a couple hours, and return home slightly aggravated but happy that your phone is working. Now there are multiple options including: mall kiosks, franchises, 3rd party shops, mobile techs, Craigslist techs, Uber style repair services, etc, etc, etc. So why is Phone Pals Repair is the best choice to repair your iPhone? First and foremost, Phone Pals is passionate about making sure the customer is happy with the service. Many companies will say this, but we truly mean this and have a great ratings to back this up. Second, we come to you. So you no longer have to do the dreaded "iPhone repair near me" search, because it makes no difference if we are near, because we will show up(on time) at your location. Along with this, the techs entering your home are insured. So when your device is getting repaired on your property, you can relax knowing that you won't be liable for any unforeseen accidents. Another great reason is that we offer both aftermarket screens and OEM quality screens. Many companies don't bother to explain that there is a difference in the quality of parts. Often times your part will be replaced, and you won't have any idea what quality part was used. We make it clear that there is a difference and will happily explain the difference. That way you know exactly what you paid for and what you received. We believe consumer education is the key to a good business! We also work on iPads and will repair a limited amount of Samsung phones. So if you are having phone issues, reach out to Phone Pals and we will get it fixed.

We are currently providing phone repair in Littleton, Lakewood, and Morrison.
